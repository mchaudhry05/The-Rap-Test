# The-Rap-Test
The Rap Test is game in which you choose a rapper whose test you would like to take. Then you go through a series of levels in which you guess the song while a snippet of that song plays. 

# Inspiration for Project/About the project 

I'm a huge music fan. One of my favorite artists is Drake. This game is actually going to replace the current theraptest.com game. I have been looking for opporotunities to combine my passion for music with my passion for programming and that is when I decided to reach out to the current creator to ask to recreate the game. The web application is built using ReactJS. 

# Where can I play/see the game? 

The game isn't actually live, however it the first playable verison of it will be out soon.  

# What are you planning on adding to it? 

Currently, I'm working on implementing the Spotify and Apple Music APIs. The Spotify API will be used to grab the rankings of the song, in regards to the most popular songs. They will then be fed into the Apple Music API to get a preview of the those songs. Since the Spotify API no longer supports song previews.
